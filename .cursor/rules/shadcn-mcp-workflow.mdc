# Shadcn UI MCP Workflow

When asked to work with **Shadcn UI** components (adding, modifying, or building UI with Shadcn):

## 1. Automatic MCP Server Usage

- **Always use the MCP server** for Shadcn-related work. Do not rely solely on training data.
- Use the available MCP tools to fetch up-to-date documentation, component specs, and code examples for Shadcn UI.

## 2. Planning Phase—Prioritize Existing Components and Blocks

During planning for anything Shadcn-related:

- **Apply existing components first**: Check the project for already-installed Shadcn components and reuse them wherever possible.
- **Prioritize blocks over custom builds**: Blocks are pre-made, full-context patterns. If a block can fulfill the requirement, prefer it over building from scratch. The MCP has full context for blocks.
- Search the codebase for `components/ui/` and any Shadcn block usage before proposing new component additions.

## 3. Implementation Phase—Demo Tool First

When actually building or integrating Shadcn components:

1. **Call the demo tool first** (or equivalent MCP tool that shows component usage).
2. Use the returned demo/example to understand:
   - Correct import paths and props
   - Recommended composition and patterns
   - Styling and variant usage
3. **Then** apply that information in the actual code.

Do not implement Shadcn components from memory alone—always verify usage via the MCP before writing code.
