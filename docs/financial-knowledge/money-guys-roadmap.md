# **The Money Guy Show: The Complete Financial Order of Operations (FOO)**

**An encyclopedic guide to Brian Preston and Bo Hanson’s 9-step roadmap for building wealth, optimizing taxes, and becoming a "Financial Mutant."**

## **Introduction: The Core Philosophy**

The Money Guy Show's philosophy is built on the concept of creating an "Army of Dollar Bills." Every dollar you earn has the potential to work for you. To maximize this potential, they created the **Financial Order of Operations (FOO)**—a mathematical, step-by-step guide designed to ensure every dollar is deployed to its highest and best use, maximizing return while minimizing risk and taxes.

The ultimate goal for a "Financial Mutant" (their term for a highly disciplined, wealth-building listener) is to save and invest **25% of their gross income** for the future.

## **The 9 Steps of the Financial Order of Operations (FOO)**

### **Step 1: Deductibles Covered**

* **The Goal:** Keep financial potholes from becoming absolute disasters.  
* **The Action:** Save up enough cash to cover your highest health or auto insurance deductible.  
* **Why:** If you get into a car accident or have a sudden medical emergency, you shouldn't have to go into high-interest credit card debt to cover it. This is your absolute baseline safety net.

### **Step 2: Employer Match**

* **The Goal:** Do not leave free money on the table.  
* **The Action:** Contribute exactly enough to your employer-sponsored retirement plan (e.g., 401(k), 403(b)) to get the maximum employer match.  
* **Why:** If your employer offers a 50% or 100% match on your contributions, that is a guaranteed 50% or 100% return on your investment on day one. There is no legal investment in the world that can mathematically beat an employer match.

### **Step 3: High-Interest Debt**

* **The Goal:** Stop paying the "stupid tax."  
* **The Action:** Aggressively pay off all high-interest debt, such as credit cards, payday loans, and personal loans.  
* **What is "High-Interest"?:** The Money Guys use a sliding scale based on your age and expected investment returns. Generally, anything in the double digits is an absolute emergency. For those in their 20s, any debt over 6% might be considered high interest. In your 40s or 50s, anything over 4-5% should be prioritized.  
* *Note:* Student loans and standard auto loans are generally evaluated based on the interest rate vs. your age, but credit cards must be destroyed immediately.

### **Step 4: Emergency Reserves**

* **The Goal:** Protect your "Army of Dollar Bills" from life's major storms.  
* **The Action:** Build a fully-funded emergency fund of 3 to 6 months of living expenses.  
* **How Much?:** \* *3 Months:* For dual-income households where both jobs are highly stable and secure.  
  * *6 Months:* For single-income households, freelancers, commissioned salespeople, or those with highly volatile jobs.

### **Step 5: Roth IRA and HSA (Health Savings Account)**

* **The Goal:** Maximize tax-free growth.  
* **The Action:** Fund a Roth IRA and/or an HSA up to the legal limits.  
* **The HSA (The Ultimate Account):** The Money Guys consider the HSA the best investment vehicle in existence because it is "triple tax-advantaged": Contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free. They advise paying for out-of-pocket medical expenses with cash (if possible) and letting the HSA money grow for retirement.  
* **The Roth IRA:** This is "Gollum's Precious." Money goes in after-tax, but the growth and withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free forever.

### **Step 6: Max-Out Retirement Options**

* **The Goal:** Lower your current tax bill and build the core of your retirement.  
* **The Action:** Return to your employer-sponsored plan (401(k), 403(b)) and increase your contributions up to the federal limit.  
* **Pre-tax vs. Roth:** If you are in a high tax bracket, you should generally utilize traditional (pre-tax) contributions to lower your current tax liability. If you are young and in a low tax bracket, use the Roth 401(k) option if available.

### **Step 7: Hyperaccumulation**

* **The Goal:** Reach the 25% savings rate and build the "Three-Bucket" strategy.  
* **The Action:** If you have maxed out Steps 1-6 and *still* haven't reached a 25% savings rate, this is where you start funding a Taxable Brokerage Account or investing in Real Estate.  
* **The Three Buckets:** You are now filling all three tax buckets for retirement: Pre-tax (401k), Tax-free (Roth/HSA), and After-tax (Brokerage). This provides ultimate flexibility to retire early and manipulate your tax brackets in retirement.

### **Step 8: Prepaid Future Expenses**

* **The Goal:** Fund "abundance" goals without sacrificing your own retirement.  
* **The Action:** Begin saving for your children's college education (e.g., using 529 plans) or other large, known future expenses.  
* **The Rule:** You must secure your own retirement *before* paying for your kids' college. You can borrow for college; you cannot borrow for retirement.

### **Step 9: Low-Interest Debt Pre-payment**

* **The Goal:** Absolute debt freedom and peace of mind.  
* **The Action:** Pay off your mortgage and any remaining low-interest student loans or car loans.  
* **Why it's Last:** Mathematically, your investments will out-earn a 3% or 4% mortgage over a 30-year period. However, The Money Guys acknowledge that going into retirement completely debt-free provides a psychological benefit and risk reduction that transcends pure math. They recommend having your mortgage completely paid off by the time you retire.

## **Essential "Money Guy" Rules of Thumb**

Beyond the FOO, The Money Guys have several strict rules regarding major purchases:

### **1\. The 20/3/8 Rule for Buying a Car**

Cars are depreciating assets that destroy wealth if bought incorrectly. If you must finance a car, follow this rule:

* **20% Down:** You must put at least 20% down to ensure you are never "underwater" (owing more than the car is worth).  
* **3 Years (36 Months):** You cannot finance the car for longer than 36 months. If you have to stretch the loan to 5 or 7 years to afford the payment, you cannot afford the car.  
* **8% of Gross Income:** Your total car payments across all vehicles cannot exceed 8% of your gross household income.  
* *Exception:* Luxury vehicles must be paid for in cash, or paid off completely within 12 months. The 20/3/8 rule only applies to reliable, standard transportation.

### **2\. The Housing Rule**

* **The Down Payment:** For your *first* home, putting down 3% to 5% is acceptable. For any subsequent homes, you should put down 20%.  
* **The Affordability Cap:** Your total housing costs (mortgage, taxes, insurance, HOA) should not exceed **25% of your gross income**.

### **3\. The Wealth Multiplier**

Every dollar you invest in your 20s has a "wealth multiplier" effect because of compound interest.

* A dollar invested at age 20 can multiply by **88 times** by age 65\.  
* A dollar invested at age 30 can multiply by **23 times**.  
* This is why they emphasize aggressive saving early in life; the "Army of Dollar Bills" needs time to recruit more soldiers.

### **4\. The "Messy Middle"**

They frequently talk about the "Messy Middle"—the period in your 30s and 40s when you are juggling a mortgage, childcare costs, career building, and saving for retirement all at once. The FOO is designed specifically to help you navigate this chaotic period without derailing your financial future.
